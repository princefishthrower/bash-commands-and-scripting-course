# commands (and flags!) covered in this lesson

which # locate a program file in the user's path, for whatever program you pass into into

# ex.
which node
which python
which python3
which gatsby
which react
which typescript

--version
# This is a flag that is implemented (nearly always?) and will print out that tool or program's version number
# Just a light warning /reminder that it is not a "true" standard, only a pseudo standard - but I've yet to find a program that doesn't implement it :)
